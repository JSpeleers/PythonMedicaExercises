# Python Medica Exercises

## Info

Using Python 3.9.5 while shadowing the `input()` function to mimic Dodona.
The code between the comments `# Solution starts here` and `# Solution ends here` is the code which needs to be pasted into Dodona.
The only noticable difference is that an `IndexError: list index out of range` in this code will mean an `EOFError: EOF when reading a line` in Dodona.

Regular `# comments` explain the reasoning behind certain statements. 
Python `""" Docstrings """` on the other hand will explain some of the Python magic that is happening.
